# Active Directory Main Functionalities
<h2>What is 'Active Directory?'</h2>
Active Directory is a centralized location 
within a server. It stores login credentials for accessing a
computer. Login credentials consist of a login ID and
password. Active Directory is accessed through the Windows
Server interface. Login IDs and passwords are used to log into
computers controlled by Active Directory

First, we will start by locating the Active Directory tool specifically the 'Active Directory Users and Computers' in the start menu. This tool is found under the start folder 'Windows Administrative tools'.

This is the application window and what it would normally be like. Users are organized into folders within Active Directory. Folders can represent departments or user groups.

Each user has a login ID and password stored within their respective folder. Organizing users allows for better management of
access permissions. Specific access permissions can be set based on user groups or departments.

Upon creating a new user, a temporary password can be assigned, forcing users to change them upon login.

Administrators can reset passwords for users in Active Directory. Password resets help users regain access to their accounts.

User groups are created to group users with similar access permissions. User groups can represent departments, roles, or projects. Users are added to their respective user groups within Active Directory.

Assigning users to user groups ensures consistent access permissions. User groups streamline access management for administrators.


<h2>Here are some common issues that can be handled with Active Directory</h2>

- DNS Configuration Problems: Active Directory heavily relies on proper DNS configuration for its functionality. Misconfigurations can lead to issues with domain name resolution, which can affect communication between devices on the network.

- Active Directory Replication Problems: This occurs when changes made on one domain controller (like adding a new user) donâ€™t get replicated to other domain controllers. This can lead to inconsistencies in the Active Directory database across different servers.

- Security Issues: These can arise from legacy management of the enterprise Microsoft platform going back a decade or more. For example, thinking an Active Directory domain is the security boundary can impact the design of security controls and may introduce vulnerabilities.

- Issues with Group Policies: Sometimes, Group Policies may not apply correctly or may cause unexpected behavior on client computers.

- Active Directory Admins Logging on to Untrusted Systems: If admins log onto untrusted systems (non-DCs, regular workstations, servers, etc.), malicious code could potentially compromise their credentials.
